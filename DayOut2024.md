# Sycamore day out

On **Saturday, April 20th**, we’ll spend the day at **Kortenberg Abbey** (Abdijdreef 22, Kortenberg). If you haven’t done so yet, you can fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/cVxniX7rQWfatbnPA) to let us know that you'll be coming. 
 
It will be a fun day of recreation, where we’ll share with each other, explore the surroundings, watch two Sycamore films and have conversations around them.
 
The topics of the day will be:
(1) The community of the Church
·      Why do we need the Church? 
·      The special place of the Catholic Church. 
·      Being Catholic today.
(2) The Holy Eucharist
·      The meaning of the Mass.
·      The Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. 
·      The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.

The day out is expected to last from **10 a.m** (meet-up in Leuven at 9 a.m., if you leave from here by public transportation) until **6:00 p.m**.
